# nimkseq
A Nim wrapper for Heng Li's kseq

The initial Nim integration was done by [Haibao Tang](https://github.com/tanghaibao) as part of his [bio-pipeline
repo](https://github.com/tanghaibao/bio-pipeline/). Haibao [granted full rights to the code base
without restrictions](https://github.com/tanghaibao/bio-pipeline/issues/4). A first pass integration
into [nimkseq](https://github.com/sdwfrost/nimkseq) starting from bio-pipeline commit 9d6a0e0 was performed by [Andreas Wilm](https://github.com/andreas-wilm/nimkseq).
